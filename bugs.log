• Nonces may still be finicky in production - very least: get rid of error messages.
• Check if tooltip can be malicious (XSS)

• Establish handler for payment success and fail.
• Integrate Paypal payment option
• Figure out how we can safely collect email addresses and shipping addresses for customers
• PayPal Integration
• Coupon integration
